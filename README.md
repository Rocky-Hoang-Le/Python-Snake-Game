# Python-Snake-Game
Classic snake game made in python
This is my first python project I made which I made without looking up any tutorials.
This is just a game based on the classic game snake where the snake is moving on its own, and the player hits directional inputs to snake the direction the snake moves.
The goal is to get the food which is the blue square and increase the score, you die if the snake touches itself or the walls.
Added an option to replay the game if desired
